Thick Mapping Response 
<br>
As Presner suggests, thick mapping is multi layered and incorporates multiplicitious narratives, sources, and contexts that challenge hegemonic cartographic practices. As he writes, “Thick maps are not simply “more data” on maps, but interrogations of the very possibility of data, mapping, and cartographic representational practices. In this sense, “thickness” arises from the never-ending friction between maps and counter-maps, constructions and de- constructions, mappings and counter-mappings.” (19) While google maps might include layers, it is not humanistic or “thick” in the same sense as thick description. However, there are some important similarities like the possibility of surveillance in all digital platforms, humanistic, progressive ones included.

The most innovative thick maps I’ve seen are those created by the Mapping Indigenous LA project, which challenge the colonial practices of geography and allow us to see the indigenous places where we live in a new light. I’ve also seen thick maps used by the New York Times to track covid-19 cases around the country and the world, among other things. I used these myself to check the infection rates in places where my friends and family live.
