Mapping American Social Movements [https://depts.washington.edu/moves/index.shtml] helps social movement historians and contemporary activists understand the historical geography of the left in the United States through interactive maps. 
The website includes maps depicting the chapters, newspaper locations, and actions of a variety of social movements, from early labor organizations like the Knights of Labor or the Industrial Workers of the World to the organizations of the Black Freedom struggle like the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and Black Panther Party to more recent movements like the 2006 immigrant rights actions. 

As a student of social movement history and specifically of socialist feminism in the United States, I agree with James Gregory that geography is essential to understanding “patterns of influence and endurance” in a country with an often fractured and discontinuous left.
Furthermore, many of the maps have a deep affective impact, such as D.J Alperovitz’s map of I.W.W members, family members, and bystanders who died while organizing, striking, taking direct action, or even just carrying the then infamous red union card. 
Remembering these unknown martyrs is a contribution to today’s labor struggles, particularly as the forces of state and capital have almost obliterated the memory and identity of the working class in the U.S.

The website is based on maps, timelines, and databases built in Tableau. Thus, historical events and figures were recorded or transcribed, recorded in spreadsheets, geocoded, given any additional categories of metadata like industry or type of action and then uploaded to Tableau with appropriate formatting. 
The complex tableau workbooks required additional processing like creating actions for interactivity. I think this technology works well, but other historians like UCLA Professor Toby Higbie have challenged Gregory and his colleagues by advocating for open source software. 

I think this website is nearly perfect, but some of the maps could use more images to go along with them. Those unfamiliar with the histories, leaders, and “rank and file” of the organizations profiled might see abstract data points and not the real people who fought and often died in these struggles.
