  <p>I am a second year Masters in Library and Information Studies student. My academic interests include community-based archives, social movement history, and gender and sexuality studies. You can view my personal website <a href="https://jmtanenbaum.github.io/welcome/">here</a>. I currently work at the June L Mazer Lesbian Archives and am dedicated to ensuring the sustainability of the Mazer and other community-based archives for the future. </p>

  I have been increasingly interested in telling stories through maps and digital exhibits for the last year or so. I began a digital <a href="https://rebelarchives.humspace.ucla.edu">project</a> last February with my colleague Jake Tompkins and partners at <b>The Freedom Archives</b> and <b>California Coalition for Women Prisoners</b> to weave together incarcerated people’s past and present struggles for liberation in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic. Our digital exhibit includes writing, ephemera, art, and film from the incarcerated people’s movements of the 1970s through the present and an interactive map and data dashboard to inspire viewers to join the urgent movement for mass releases during the COVID-19 crisis. This project sparked my interest in using Digital Humanities tools to tell the stories of social movement history. I soon enrolled in Miriam Posner’s Digital Humanities class, and then decided to pursue the certificate. I have created maps with Tableau before, but I am interested in learning how to use open-source tools like Leaflet and geocode data more effectively. I also know a little bit of html, java, and python, but I usually end up using tools with a graphical user interface instead of writing scripts.
